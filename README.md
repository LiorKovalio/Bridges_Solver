# Bridges_Solver
This project offers a naive approach to solve the Bridges puzzle. (AKA Gishurim, can be found on the app "Simon Tatham's Puzzles" in the google play store)

The solver uses 3 heuristics:
* apply pigeonhole principle
* if there is only one way to satisfy the wanted connection number, connect so
* if there are no clues for the previous methods use backtracking
